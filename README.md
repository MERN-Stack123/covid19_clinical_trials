# 🦠 COVID-19 Clinical Trials Analysis Using Data Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **COVID-19 clinical trials data** to understand treatment trends, intervention outcomes, and patterns in trial designs worldwide.  
The analysis is performed using **Jupyter Notebooks** and **data analytics techniques**, with a strong emphasis on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, visualization, and clinical insights.

This project is suitable for **academic purposes, data science portfolios, internships, and healthcare analytics practice**.
